# Learning iOS Development
Pathway for learning iOS development, generated by ChatGPT

Prompt:

Develop an effective learning pathway/curriculum for an Android developer who wants to become an iOS engineer.
The curriculum should be structured into modules and sub-topics. The first module should contain oop and programming in swift.
These contents should follow best practices as of 2021.

Make it a step-by-step guide and include references with links to free, rich and easy-to-understand resources (E.g official documentation, YouTube playlist, Raywenerlich etc).


The goal is to become a senior iOS engineer in 3 months.

If you need any clarification on the task, pls ask questions before you proceed.
